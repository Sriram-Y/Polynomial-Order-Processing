# Polynomial-Order-Processing
Java program for polynomial order processing using Linked Lists

This program examines a file of polynomials and determines whether the polynomials in that file 
are in stricly ascending order using two different methods of comparison.

Program consists of 4 classes and one sub class (for linked list representation)

Main.java
Allows user to select input file from directory

Polynomial.java
Defines an individual polynomial with objects of sub class Node making up each term. Class also contains methods to compare, iterator and print polynomial

OrderedList.java
Defines checkSorted exception

InvalidPolynomialSyntax.java
Invalid syntax for polynomial exception message handling
